# Creating an offline installer

## THIS SCRIPT MUST BE USED ON MACOS

To use these scripts, you must first obtain a `.app` file for your respecive installer, whether using the app store, gibMacOS, or finding it on the internet. Save that file to the applications folder, then run the correct script for your macOS version like this:
```
./bigsur-offline.sh
```

Once the script finishes you should have the .dmg file on your desktop.
